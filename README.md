# Credit_Risk_Analysis

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of this assignment was to see whether or not the loan was a high risk or not. Basically was a credit card worth the risk to the consumer.

Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

* The first data set is showing that there are not many false positives which is good and giving us alomost a one in spec

* The second picture is showing much more positive numbers and the precision data itself for low risk is showing close to one meaning it is a mmuch better choice.

* This photo is showing that the recall is not even close to 50% meaning that less than 50 percent is accurate . This is not a great score as we want this to be a higher number meaning more applications and whether it is a risk or not is accurate data.

* This is a much better recall and precision showing that the precision is closer to one and recall is better so our data for this is more accurate. The f1 score is also higher meaning that the relation between recall and precision is more imbalanced.

* This data is almost perfect because the relation between precision , recall abd f1 is almost positive meaning the data and information is giving us the most accurate and true results.

* This is the model that I would use seeing how recall is showing the 94 percent of the data is proper and not false. F1 in this model is also closest to one
